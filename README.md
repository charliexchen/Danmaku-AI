# DanmakuBot

Danmaku (弹幕) refers to these really hard arcade shoot 'em up games (like space invaders), where the entire screen gets covered in bullets, and the player has to weave between the bullets in order to survive.

Years ago, in high school, I tried making such a game in GameMaker. Whilst I have since lost the code for that project, one thing I attempted to do back then was to implement a simple AI to autoplay the game. I was not very successful back then, since I attempted to hardcode the entire process.

This was a second attempt at that problem using neural networks and evolution.
